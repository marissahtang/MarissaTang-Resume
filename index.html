        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Marissa Tang and I am an undergraduate student at the University of California: Riverside. Over the past couple of years, I was able to obtain some knowledge concerning work experience through volunteering at different locations: a convalescent home, a local food bank, country club festivals, and a photocopy service company. 

At the convalescent home, I helped and guided the other volunteers in providing extra comfort and services for the elderly there. We visited about once a month for 4 years until quarantine started. For the local food bank, I aided in piling and hanging up clothes for the unfortunate and prepare meals in packages. This event usually occurred during Thanksgiving and wintertime. At the country club festivals, it was a three-day job that required many volunteers. The first day consisted of setting up tables, cutlery, chairs, lights, cleaning the buckets, and wiping down the dust. Then came the day of the event where the volunteers would dress professionally and tend to the people that came to have fun. There were people in charge of the bingo station, handing out the food, tending to tables in case they needed anything, cleaners, and many more. The last day would be cleaning up and closing up the area for the next year. Lastly, my volunteer work at a photocopy service company was brief but encouraging. In there, I was able to help the workers with anything they needed whether it was obtaining the location or claim numbers of certain cases or sorting the mail for the next shipment to a certain customer. It allowed me to have a glimpse at the life of working in an office and encouraged me to work harder.
